# The Bellman Equation: simplify our value estimation [[bellman-equation]]

The Bellman equation **simplifies our state value or state-action value calculation.**

With what we learned from now, we know that if we calculate the \\(V(S_t)\\) (value of a state), we need to calculate the return starting at that state and then follow the policy forever after. **(Our policy that we defined in the following example is a Greedy Policy, and for simplification, we don't discount the reward).**

So to calculate \\(V(S_t)\\), we need to make the sum of the expected rewards. Hence:

Then, to calculate the \\(V(S_{t+1})\\), we need to calculate the return starting at that state \\(S_{t+1}\\).

So you see, that's a pretty tedious process if you need to do it for each state value or state-action value.

Instead of calculating the expected return for each state or each state-action pair, **we can use the Bellman equation.**

The Bellman equation is a recursive equation that works like this: instead of starting for each state from the beginning and calculating the return, we can consider the value of any state as:

**The immediate reward  \\(R_{t+1}\\)  + the discounted value of the state that follows ( \\(gamma * V(S_{t+1}) \\) ) .**

If we go back to our example, the value of State 1= expected cumulative return if we start at that state.

To calculate the value of State 1: the sum of rewards **if the agent started in that state 1** and then followed the **policy for all the time steps.**

Which is equivalent to  \\(V(S_{t})\\)  = Immediate reward  \\(R_{t+1}\\)  + Discounted value of the next state  \\(gamma * V(S_{t+1})\\)

For simplification, here we don't discount, so gamma = 1.

- The value of  \\(V(S_{t+1}) \\)  = Immediate reward  \\(R_{t+2}\\)  + Discounted value of the next state ( \\(gamma * V(S_{t+2})\\) ).
- And so on.

To recap, the idea of the Bellman equation is that instead of calculating each value as the sum of the expected return, **which is a long process.** This is equivalent **to the sum of immediate reward + the discounted value of the state that follows.**
