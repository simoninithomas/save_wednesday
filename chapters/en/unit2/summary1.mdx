# Summary [[summary1]]

Before diving on Q-Learning, let's summarize what we just learned.

We have two types of value-based functions:

- State-Value function: outputs the expected return if **the agent starts at a given state and acts accordingly to the policy forever after.**
- Action-Value function: outputs the expected return if **the agent starts in a given state, takes a given action at that state** and then acts accordingly to the policy forever after.
- In value-based methods, **we define the policy by hand** because we don't train it, we train a value function. The idea is that if we have an optimal value function, we **will have an optimal policy.**

There are two types of methods to learn a policy for a value function:

- With *the Monte Carlo method*, we update the value function from a complete episode, and so we **use the actual accurate discounted return of this episode.**
- With *the TD Learning method,* we update the value function from a step, so we replace Gt that we don't have with **an estimated return called TD target.**
