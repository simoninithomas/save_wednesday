# Introduction [[introduction]]

One of the most critical task in Deep Reinforcement Learning is to find a good set of training hyperparameters.

Optuna is a library that helps you to automate the search. In this Unit, we'll study a little bit of the theory behind automatic hyperparameter tuning. We'll then try to optimize the parameters manually and then see how to automate the search using Optuna.
