Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence: **Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Deep RL is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns **how to behave** in an environment **by performing actions** and **seeing the results.**

So in this first chapter, **you’ll learn the foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Then, you'll train your first two Deep Reinforcement Learning agents:

1. A Lunar Lander agent that will learn to **land correctly on the Moon 🌕**
2. A car that neads **to reach the top of the mountain ⛰️ **.

And finally you’ll **upload it to the Hugging Face Hub 🤗, a free, open platform where people can share ML models, datasets and demos.**

Here’s what you’re going to accomplish at the end of this unit.

It’s essential **to master these elements** before diving into implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. The goal of this chapter is to give you solid foundations.

So let’s get started! 🚀
